`In Java exceptions under Error and RuntimeException classes are unchecked exceptions, everything else under throwable is checked. `


### Use checked exceptions for recoverable conditions and 
By throwing a checked exception, you force the caller to handle
 the exception in a catch clause or to propagate it outward. 


### runtime exceptions for programming errors

The great major-ity of runtime exceptions indicate 
precondition violations. A precondition violation is simply
 a failure by the client of an API to adhere to the contract 
 established by the API specification. 

#### all of the unchecked throwables you implement should subclass RuntimeException


```To summarize, throw checked exceptions for
 recoverable conditions and unchecked exceptions for programming errors.

 When in doubt, throw unchecked exceptions.


 Donâ€™t define any throwables that are neither checked exceptions 
nor runtime exceptions. 

Provide methods on your checked exceptions to aid in recovery.```
