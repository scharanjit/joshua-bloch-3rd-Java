equals  ==> Reflexivity (an object must be equal to itself. ), Symmetry
 ( objects must agree on whether they are equal.) Transitivity (one object is equal to a second and the second object 
 is equal to a third, then the first object must be equal to the third.)


2.) Always override hashCode when you override equals()

3.) Always override toString

4.) clone method (see example DogName.java)

5.) Comparable (Case Insensitive String)
